# web-scrappers
Web scrappers designed to extract Job related information for a particular location from Indeed, Monster.com etc

This will contain code for all of the web-scrapers I have ever built, with the idea that maybe this will save work for somebody else building a scraper for the same site, or a similar site.

In terms of the way this is structured, for the time being I am planning on putting scrapers for different websites (defined by the domain named) into different folders. In any case, within the READMEs for each folder, I will give the description of how to use the scraper in that folder.

Notes -

The majority, if not all, of these scrapers will not actively be kept up to date. So, if the website that they were built on changes in a way that it breaks the scraper, users will have to refactor the scraper to account for that.

As a last quick note - all of these are built using Python 3. That might be worth nothing given the current state of the libraries available in Python 2 and 3 for interacting with the web.
